Paragraphs:
JSON.stringify returns a string that perfectly preserves the paragraph
(JSON.stringify the innerHTML)
Restore the para by using JSON.parse on the string

if x is the element, str = JSON.stringify(x.innerHTML)
then if y is a new element, y.innerHTML = JSON.parse(str)

Images: ongoing not possible with stringify/parse shit
get the .src attribute as string and assign


Video & Audio: use currentSrc, same thing as Images. src also works
audio controls id...src...
video controls id...src.. seems to be required!

Need to design JSON objects for this stuff

text divs = perfectly preserved by taking the innerHTML, creating a new div and putting there. Good.
